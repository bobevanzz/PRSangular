	<h3>A brief description of Scrum</h3>
	<p>Scrum is a lightweight framework designed to help small, close-knit teams of people develop complex products.<br> The brainchild of a handful of software engineers working together in the late 20th Century, scrum has gained the<br> most traction in the technology sector, but it is not inherently technical and you can easily adapt the tools and<br> practices described in this book to other industries. You can use scrum to build a better mousetrap, for example, or<br> to run the marketing division of a puppy chow company. You can even use it to collaborate on writing a book we did.<br>		
A scrum team typically consists of around seven people who work together in short, sustainable bursts of activity cal-<br>led sprints, with plenty of time for review and reflection built in. One of the mantras of scrum is inspect and adapt,<br> and scrum teams are characterized by an intense focus on continuous improvementâ€”of their process, but also of the<br> product.
This tiny book is a just-the-facts-maam introduction to the various moving parts of scrum: the various roles,<br> artifacts and events that occupy the sprint cycle. </p>
<h3>How we used Scrum and how if affected the creation of the site</h3>
<p> At first we had a hard time trying to divy up the work into smaller amounts to make it easier as a whole. On this<br> sprint we're aiming for complex and difficult tasks, sitting the bar high so to speak. So far it's working out well, pedal to the metal!
