<h3>Interesting and relevant facts:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The wolverine is a powerful animal that resembles a small bear but is actually the largest member of the Mustelidae (weasel) family.</li>
	<li>Their habitats include Alpine forests, boreal forests, grasslands, tundra and rocky areas (inland cliffs and mountain peaks).</li>
	<li>Wolverines have thick, dark, oily fur which is highly hydrophobic, making it resistant to frost making them experts at living in the Arctic.</li>
	<li>Wolverines have poor eyesight, but their senses of hearing and smell are excellent, which help them find the prey more easily.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How the Wolverines get food</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The wolverine is a powerful and versatile predator and scavenger. They easily dispatch smaller prey, such as rabbits and rodents, but may even attack animals many times their size, such as caribou, if the prey appears to be weak or injured. These opportunistic eaters also feed on carrion â€” the corpses of larger mammals, such as elk, deer, and caribou.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Predator protection</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The mountain lion, wolf, and bear are predators of the wolverine. However, the human is recognized as the primary predator of the wolverine.
</li>
</ol>
<<h3>Sleeping habits</h3>
<ol>
	<li>These hunters are nocturnal, which means they sleep during the day and hunt at night.</li>
